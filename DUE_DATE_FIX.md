# Due Date Consistency Fix

## Problem
Different browsers show different overdue states because due dates are cached in localStorage, causing inconsistent task states across users. Additionally, Safari had JavaScript errors when parsing certain date formats.

## Solution
Removed localStorage due date caching. Tasks now use month/day from JSON with current year dynamically. Firebase only tracks completion status. Added Safari compatibility fixes for date parsing.

## Issue Title Suggestion
"Fix inconsistent due dates across browsers by removing localStorage caching and Safari compatibility"
